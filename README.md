 City of Rome Route Finder

Objective of this team CA was to create a Java app that takes in any suitable map, in this case Rome, that searches for and retrieves routes between
landmarks given a starting point and a destination using custom graph data structures.

The app creates multiple routes from start to destination based on different filters. 
This app allows for the selection of any point on the map or the selction of an already established landmark and will calculate multiple shortest routes implenting 
a choice of Dijkstra's, Depth First Seach, Breadth First Search algorithms.

It also includes waypoint support along with the ability to search shortest routes with preference of route given to historical significance or easiest terrain
This is achieved through the addition of costs on the links between landmarks. Landmarks are also fully persistent.
